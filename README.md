# CampusChefs

CampusChefs focuses on providing a streamlined, user-friendly experience for students who need quick and easy meal solutions without the hassles of standard recipe-based websites like advertisements and lengthy descriptions that donâ€™t pertain to the recipe itself. The web app draft allows users to post recipes, edit and delete them as needed, and discover other recipes by filtering them by tags or searching for keywords.
